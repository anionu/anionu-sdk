This guide is designed to quicken the process of compiling LibSourcey in a linux environment. The steps below were written for Ubuntu 11.04 - Natty Narwhal - but should be easy to port to other systems.


1) Build and Install LibSourcey

2) Download and compile the Anionu module

1. You can download the Anionu module directly from: https://bitbucket.org/sourcey/anionu
Better yet you can clone the repository: git clone https://bitbucket.org/sourcey/anionu.git
The Anionu folder should end up in the librourcey/libs folder alongside all other LibSourcey modules and applications.

3) Compile the Anionu module

1. Open up Cmake. The source directory should point to ".../librourcey", and the binary directory to ".../librourcey/build" the same as when compiling LibSourcey.

2. Ensure BUILD_MODULES is checked and generate the project makefiles. Remember that individual modules may be enabled/disabled via advanced options.

3. Open up ".../librourcey/build" in a terminal window and:

make
sudo make install
